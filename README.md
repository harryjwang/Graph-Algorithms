# Graph-Algorithms
This project is a C++ toolkit for building and analyzing graphs. It includes implementations of adjacency list representations and core algorithms such as depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and connectivity queries. The program constructs graphs from input files and supports dynamic updates and queries through a command-driven interface.

One of the central design goals was efficiency â€” both in terms of time complexity and memory usage. The adjacency list structure ensures scalability for sparse graphs, while careful implementation of traversal algorithms keeps runtime performance predictable.

Beyond correctness, this project emphasizes flexibility. By structuring the code into well-defined classes and functions, the toolkit can easily be extended with new algorithms like shortest path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) or spanning trees (Kruskal, Prim). The inclusion of automated test cases ensures robustness and provides a framework for future experimentation.

This project not only demonstrates mastery of graph theory concepts but also shows how theoretical algorithms can be implemented in performant, reusable C++ code for practical applications in networking, logistics, and computational modeling.
